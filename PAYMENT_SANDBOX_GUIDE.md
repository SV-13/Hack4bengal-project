## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"lender_email column not found"**
- Run database migration: `npx supabase db reset`
- Ensure all migrations are applied

**Payment popup doesn't appear**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Razorpay script is loading
- Check network connectivity

**Test payments always fail**
- Verify using correct test credentials
- Check that payment config has `testMode: true`
- Ensure using test card numbers, not real ones

**Bank transfer instructions not showing**
- Check payment processor configuration
- Verify bank transfer is enabled in payment methods

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem('payment_debug', 'true');
```

This will show detailed payment processing logs in the browser console.
