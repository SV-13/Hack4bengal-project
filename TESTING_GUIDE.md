# 🧪 Functionality Testing Guide

## ✅ ERRORS FIXED IN testDatabase.ts

### Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **RPC Function Error**: `supabase.rpc('version')` doesn't exist
   - **Fixed**: Replaced with actual table insert test
2. **Variable Scope Error**: `schemaError` was undefined

### Current Test Functions:
- `testDatabaseConnection()` - Tests connectivity and permissions
