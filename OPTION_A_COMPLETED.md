- **Cleaned up imports** - Removed unused `Wand2` icon import
- **Enhanced status creation** - Added descriptive comment for `pending` status
- **Production-ready form** - No more test data or debug helpers

### 3. LoanAcceptanceModal Enhanced Status Flow âœ…
- **Improved acceptance logic** - Better status transition from `pending` -> `accepted`
- **Added borrower signature tracking** - Records timestamp when borrower accepts/rejects
- **Enhanced rejection handling** - Only allows rejection of pending agreements
- **Better notification system** - Lender gets notified when borrower accepts offer

- **Implementation roadmap** - Next steps for payment integration and repayment tracking

## Current Status Flow Implementation

### âœ… Currently Working
1. **Loan Creation** - Lender creates offer with status `pending`
2. **Loan Acceptance** - Borrower accepts with status `accepted`
3. **Loan Rejection** - Borrower rejects with status `rejected`
4. **Dashboard Stats** - Correctly calculates totals using real data

### ðŸš§ Next Steps (Future Options)
1. **Payment Integration** - `accepted` -> `funded` transition
2. **Repayment Tracking** - `funded` -> `repaid` with payment records
3. **Automated Notifications** - Status-based email/push notifications
4. **Overdue Detection** - Automatic status updates for missed payments

## Technical Improvements Made

### Database Interactions

- Added proper WHERE conditions to prevent race conditions
- Improved notification creation with fallback handling

### User Experience
- Real-time activity feed showing latest agreements
- Proper status badges with color coding
- Enhanced form validation and user feedback

### Code Quality
- Removed all test/debug code
- Consistent error handling patterns
